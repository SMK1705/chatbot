      "Based on your recent activities, you're already on the right track with running and yoga! To further improve your fitness, you might consider adding variety to your workouts. This could include different types of exercises to challenge different muscle groups and improve overall fitness. For instance, you could incorporate strength training twice a week to build muscle and increase metabolism. You might also consider adding a second run or a longer one to further enhance your cardiovascular health. Additionally, active recovery days, such as walking or cycling, can help improve endurance and speed while allowing your body to rest. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and rest when needed. Would you like help in scheduling these activities into your week?\n"
